## Overview
The main focus of my project is to show that advancements made in Formula 1 by different manufacturers are reflected in consumer-grade cars made by the same manufacturers. Our goal is to draw a direct correlation between Formula 1 budget cost to fuel efficieny in Formula 1 vehicles and show a trickle-down effect to consumer-grade motor vehicles fuel efficiency and the effect this has on CO2 emissions.
## Data
#### This graph shows the budget spent by different manufacture from 1999-2014.

The budget of each manufacturer has a direct correlation to success within Formula 1. The amount spent by the winning team is above the average budget cost for that year and the consistency of high budget to success allows it to be said budget=success.
