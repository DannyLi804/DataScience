## Overview
The main focus of my project is to show that advancements made in Formula 1 by different manufactures is reflected in consumer-grade cars made by the same manufactures. Our goal is to draw a direct correlation between Formula 1 budget cost to fuel efficieny in Formula 1 vehicles and then show a trickle down affect to consumer-grade motor vehicles fuel efficiency and the affect this has on C02 Emissions. 
#### This graph shows the budget spent by different manufacture from 1999-2014.

The budget of each manufacturer has a direct correlation to success within Formula 1. The amount spent by the winning team is above the average budget cost for that year, but there is one outlier in 2009, but the consistency of high budget to success allows it to be said budget=success.
